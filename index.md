### CPSC 120

* Lab 5

 Part 1 of Lab 5 was very enjoyable for me, it involved a very simple yet very engaging task of creating an orderly sandwich. This was a straightforward exercise, gave me that quick boost of interest in the upcoming labs but also highlighted the importance of following proper order for the maketest so it would work correctly.


* Lab 7

Part 1 lab 7 even though this lab proved to be one of the challenging labs I have encountered so far, it left me with valuable experience on how to create a blackjack game. It was my very first attempt at designing a game that allowed the player to have five chances, overall it was a very rewarding experience. 


* Lab 12

 Both parts of Lab 12 Part 1 and Part 2 introduced me to the world of animations for the very first time. The morning lecture clarified many aspects of the lab. Once I began working in the lab I understood that I was required to replicate the animation from the readme file. Through this lab I gained another valuable experience in crafting animations with color adding more skills to my skill set.
